## 3. Common Programming Concepts

### Variables and Mutability

* by default variables are immutable.

### Constants

â€‹	`Constants` are not allowed to change, but there are differences between constants and immutable variables.

* declare constants using the `const` keyword.
* the type of value must be annotated.
* may be set only a constant expression, not the result of a value that could only be computed at runtime.
* naming convention for constants: use all uppercase with underscores between words.
* Naming hardcoded  values used throughout program as constants.
